Tests to do with Linux scripts

- Run ./tt.sh to have all tests run and results displayed. It requires
the binary executable to be available in ../src, as per default build.
Only tests in sub-directories starting with a 't' are processed. Therefore
u22 is not by default. This one takes time by definition -> it tests
the behavior of the program with huge stack sizes.

This test suite is not intended to be clean, portable, etc., so it's easily
confused if you start to tune ./configure parameters.

Next step: convert it to DejaGNU...
