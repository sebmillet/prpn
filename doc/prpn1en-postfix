.SH "LINEAR EQUATIONS SYSTEMS RESOLUTION"
.TP
You can solve a linear system by dividing a vector by a matrix.
.br
.I Example
You would like to resolve the system
.br
  2x - y + z = 13
  x + 5y +3z = 3
  -2x + 4z = 4
.br
Type in the vector
.br
  [13 3 4]
.br
Then type in the matrix
.br
  [[2 -1 1][1 5 3][-2 0 4]]
.br
Do a division by clicking the '/' button. Here you go with
the result:
.br
  [4 -2 3]
.br
That reads "the solution is x = 4, y = -2 and z = 3"

.B Note about booleans
A test (IF, WHILE or UNTIL, see below) takes one item in the stack. The item
must be of type real. Any non-null value is treated as TRUE, a null value is
FALSE.
.br
Below, the term "bottom item of the stack" refers to the actual object at
level 1 of the stack.
.TP
.B IF/THEN/ELSE/END sequence
Execute the instructions between IF and THEN.
.br
Then, take the bottom item of the stack, if it is true (see above), execute
the instructions between THEN and ELSE (or END if ELSE is not provided),
otherwise execute the ELSE instructions. ELSE is optional.
.TP
.I Example 1
Take the first item in the stack and tell whether it is positive or null, or
negative
.br
<< IF 0 >= THEN "Positive or null" ELSE "Negative" END >>
.TP
.I Example 2
Always execute the THEN part
.br
<< IF 1 THEN "Always executed" ELSE "Never executed" END >>
.TP
.I Example 3
Do nothing (!)
.br
<< IF 0 THEN "Never executed" END >>
.TP
.B WHILE/REPEAT/END sequence
Execute the instructions between WHILE and REPEAT.
.br
Then take the bottom item of the stack, if it is true (see above), execute the
instructions after REPEAT, then restart the sequence from the beginning of the
WHILE.
.TP
.I Example
Calculate the smallest N for which sum(i^2 with i taking all integer values in
the range 1..N) >= 100
.br
<< 0 0 -> n << WHILE DUP 100 < REPEAT n SQ + n 1 + 'n' STO END n >> >>
.TP
.B DO/UNTIL/END sequence
Execute the instructions between DO and UNTIL, then, between UNTIL and END.
.br
Then, take the bottom item of the stack, if it is true (see above), restart
the sequence from the beginning of the DO.
.TP
.I Example
Calculate the smallest N for which sum(1/i with i taking all integer values in the range 1..N) >= 3
.br
<< 0 0 -> n << DO n 1 + 'n' STO n INV + UNTIL DUP 7 >= END n >> >>
.TP
.B FOR|START/NEXT|STEP sequence
FOR or START launches a loop. It takes two arguments, the first argument
(second level in the stack) being the start counter value, the second one
(first level in the stack) being the target counter value, beyond which to
stop the loop.
.br
START is an anonymous loop, FOR takes one name and uses it as a local variable
for the loop counter.
.br
NEXT adds 1 to the counter if the target is greater than the start, subtracts
1 otherwise.
.br
STEP takes one argument in the stack and adds it to the counter. NEXT can be
used with either FOR or START, same with STEP.
.TP
.I Example 1
Calculate the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 10
.br
<< 0 1 10 FOR i i SQ + NEXT >>
.TP
.I Example 2
Calculate sum(2^i with i taking all integer values in the range 1..N), N being
the first value in the stack
.br
<< 0 1 1 4 ROLL START DUP ROT + SWAP 2 * NEXT DROP >> EVAL
.TP
.I Example 3
Calculate sum(i with i taking all odd integer values in the range 1..N), N
being the first value in the stack
.br
<< 0 1 ROT FOR i i + 2 STEP >>

.B Difference between prpn and prpnc
.TP
.I Linux
prpn can be run with -c option. In that case it is almost identical to prpnc. "Almost" only. prpn is compiled with WxWidgets library and performs GUI-specific initializations upon startup. If graphical resources aren't found, it won't execute. For example, if you run the following command
.br
\fB	DISPLAY="" prpn -c\fP
.br
You get this result
.br
\fB	Error: Unable to initialize gtk, is DISPLAY set properly?\fP
.br
prpnc solves this situation, as it is *not* compiled against WxWidgets and can run in a simple terminal with no graphical resources at all. Note a clean way to improve all this would be to prevent WxWidgets from initializing the GUI whenever -c is provided. If you know how to do that in a robust way (portable across systems and versions...), this program' author is interested!
.TP
.I Windows
prpn.exe can *not* be run with -c. For some reason, under Windows, WxWidgets disconnects the running program from the controlling terminal. The solutions is the same as Linux' except that under Windows, it is mandatory: you must run prpnc.exe if you wish to use the command line version of the calculator.
