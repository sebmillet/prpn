NAME
       pRPN - a portable RPN calculator


SYNOPSIS
       prpn [options]
       prpnc [options]

       prpn  is	 the main, GUI, executable. prpnc is the command line version.
       prpnc is equivalent to prpn -c.


DESCRIPTION
       The pRPN program is a RPN calculator inspired by HP calculators of late
       80s.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
	      Display a quick help screen and exit.

       -v --version
	      Display version information and exit.

       -c, --console
	      Run  in  console	mode. Useful for prpn only. prpnc runs only in
	      console mode.

       -w, --width width
	      Set width to width, measured in number of	 characters.  Defaults
	      to 23.

       -h, --height height
	      Set  height  to height, measured in number of lines. Defaults to
	      5.

       --min-stack-height min-stack-height
	      Set minimum stack height to height, measured in number of lines.
	      Defaults to height. Only in console mode.

       -b, --batch
	      Batch mode, implies console mode.

       -z, --dry-run
	      Ignore rc files.

       -a, --class
	      Display class count before exiting.

       -d, --debug debug_option
	      Debug mode, requires a parameter.

LINEAR EQUATIONS SYSTEMS RESOLUTION
       You can solve a linear system by dividing a vector by a matrix.
	      Example You would like to resolve the system
		2x - y + z = 13
		x + 5y +3z = 3
		-2x + 4z = 4
	      Type in the vector
		[13 3 4]
	      Then type in the matrix
		[[2 -1 1][1 5 3][-2 0 4]]
	      Do  a  division by clicking the '/' button. Here you go with the
	      result:
		[4 -2 3]
	      That reads "the solution is x = 4, y = -2 and z = 3"

PROGRAM CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS
       Note about booleans
	      A test (IF, WHILE or UNTIL, see below) takes  one	 item  in  the
	      stack.  The  item	 must  be  of type real. Any non-null value is
	      treated as TRUE, a null value is FALSE.
	      Below, the term "bottom item of the stack" refers to the	actual
	      object at level 1 of the stack.

       IF/THEN/ELSE/END sequence
	      Execute the instructions between IF and THEN.
	      Then,  take  the	bottom	item  of the stack, if it is true (see
	      above), execute the instructions between THEN and ELSE  (or  END
	      if  ELSE	is  not provided), otherwise execute the ELSE instruc‐
	      tions. ELSE is optional.

       Example 1
	      Take the first item in the stack and tell whether it is positive
	      or null, or negative
	      << IF 0 >= THEN "Positive or null" ELSE "Negative" END >>

       Example 2
	      Always execute the THEN part
	      << IF 1 THEN "Always executed" ELSE "Never executed" END >>

       Example 3
	      Do nothing (!)
	      << IF 0 THEN "Never executed" END >>

       WHILE/REPEAT/END sequence
	      Execute the instructions between WHILE and REPEAT.
	      Then  take  the  bottom  item  of	 the stack, if it is true (see
	      above), execute the instructions after REPEAT, then restart  the
	      sequence from the beginning of the WHILE.

       Example
	      Calculate the smallest N for which sum(i^2 with i taking all in‐
	      teger values in the range 1..N) >= 100
	      << 0 0 -> n << WHILE DUP 100 < REPEAT n SQ + n 1 + 'n' STO END n
	      >> >>

       DO/UNTIL/END sequence
	      Execute the instructions between DO and UNTIL, then, between UN‐
	      TIL and END.
	      Then, take the bottom item of the stack,	if  it	is  true  (see
	      above), restart the sequence from the beginning of the DO.

       Example
	      Calculate the smallest N for which sum(1/i with i taking all in‐
	      teger values in the range 1..N) >= 3
	      << 0 0 -> n << DO n 1 + 'n' STO n INV + UNTIL DUP 7 >= END n  >>
	      >>

       FOR|START/NEXT|STEP sequence
	      FOR  or START launches a loop. It takes two arguments, the first
	      argument (second level in the stack)  being  the	start  counter
	      value,  the second one (first level in the stack) being the tar‐
	      get counter value, beyond which to stop the loop.
	      START is an anonymous loop, FOR takes one name and uses it as  a
	      local variable for the loop counter.
	      NEXT  adds  1  to	 the counter if the target is greater than the
	      start, subtracts 1 otherwise.
	      STEP takes one argument in the stack and adds it to the counter.
	      NEXT can be used with either FOR or START, same with STEP.

       Example 1
	      Calculate the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 10
	      << 0 1 10 FOR i i SQ + NEXT >>

       Example 2
	      Calculate	 sum(2^i with i taking all integer values in the range
	      1..N), N being the first value in the stack
	      << 0 1 1 4 ROLL START DUP ROT + SWAP 2 * NEXT DROP >> EVAL

       Example 3
	      Calculate sum(i with i taking all	 odd  integer  values  in  the
	      range 1..N), N being the first value in the stack
	      << 0 1 ROT FOR i i + 2 STEP >>

BUGS
       LNP1 and EXPM

       These functions are supposed to bring extra accuracy near x  =  0.  Re‐
       minder:
	      LNP1(x) = LN(X + 1) and EXPM(x) = EXP(x) - 1
	      For  now, these functions do NOT bring extra accuracy, they just
	      call underlying LN() and EXP() functions.

       Difference between prpn and prpnc

       Linux  prpn can be run with -c option. In that case it is almost	 iden‐
	      tical  to	 prpnc. "Almost" only. prpn is compiled with WxWidgets
	      library and performs GUI-specific initializations upon  startup.
	      If graphical resources aren't found, it won't execute. For exam‐
	      ple, if you run the following command
		   DISPLAY="" prpn -c
	      You get this result
		   Error: Unable to initialize gtk, is DISPLAY set properly?
	      prpnc solves this situation, as it  is  *not*  compiled  against
	      WxWidgets and can run in a simple terminal with no graphical re‐
	      sources at all. Note a clean way to improve all this would be to
	      prevent  WxWidgets from initializing the GUI whenever -c is pro‐
	      vided. If you know how to do that	 in  a	robust	way  (portable
	      across  systems and versions...), this program' author is inter‐
	      ested!

       Windows
	      prpn.exe can *not* be run with -c. For some reason,  under  Win‐
	      dows,  WxWidgets	disconnects  the running program from the con‐
	      trolling terminal. The solutions is the same  as	Linux'	except
	      that  under  Windows, it is mandatory: you must run prpnc.exe if
	      you wish to use the command line version of the calculator.
